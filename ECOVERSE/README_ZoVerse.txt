ZoVerse Engine Core

This package contains the modular logic and scripts for ZoVerse's operational engine, which includes:

1. AI Agents: Dawn & Dust with sentient automation hooks
2. EraScript: Publishing, library, royalties, and IP controls
3. NuBank: Financial engine for donations, royalties, and smart routing
4. Intake & Avatar Ops: Role assignment, access management
5. Operator Dashboard: Trigger system for all core functions
6. Codex: Infinite publishing cycles with soulbound entries

All revenue flows through Nu Vizion (UCC-1 Trust) and NuWurldEra (501c3), ensuring a closed-loop economic model.
