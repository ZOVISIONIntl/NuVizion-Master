EraScript Publishing Web UI

Deployment Instructions:
1. Place the component file into your /pages or /src/components folder (Next.js or React)
2. Ensure Tailwind CSS is set up and UI libraries (shadcn/ui) are installed
3. Link the endpoint /api/publish to your operator backend (Flask/FastAPI/etc.)
4. Launch locally or push to your live ZoVerse deployment

This UI enables live publishing of books, codex, poems, scripts, and music entries.
